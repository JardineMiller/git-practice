Once upon a time a superhero slept in.
She was tried of fixing the mess that the human beings kept making.
Her motivation was at an all time low.
Eventually she managed to drag herself out of bed.
And showered the world in puppies, thinking it was a good idea. But instead everyone drowned in puppes.
The end.
